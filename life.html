The <span>NKN (National Knowledge Network)</span> program is the Internet service provider for the institute and supports network speeds of up to 1 GB/s. Although in the elementary stage, the NKN network is useful as it provides connectivity to other institutes, has resources like video lectures, seminars etc. Each student has access to the network through the LAN ports provided in the hostel rooms as well as Wi-Fi (each student is allotted a unique ID-Password for accessing). We also have a DC++ culture in the hostel (Google it and you will learn that DC++ is the life line of IIT hostels). It is a really productive file sharing system with a host server and various other clients linked to it. It comes in handy to share large files, academic softwares and recreational stuff (like movies, games, TV series). Students are encouraged to avail the benefits of the system in the hostel. Apart from the above, all students have access to a common file storage system. Students can use it as a drive to drop/retrieve/share files with peers.</p>
