But often in such a competitive environment, work is stressed to the point of mania and this is when comes in the need of recreation. Rediscover your hobbies and explore new ones with Clubs at IIT Bhilai. Mind you there is absolutely no bound on anyone’s interest which also means that there is no bound on how many clubs you can be in – it is all up to you. Currently the following clubs are functional and conduct their respective activities at a regular basis:</p>

As a new society, we have not had any activities conducted yet, but we have prepared an introductory newsletter as a part of the launch. The initial activities are planned to be in the form of presentations. Once we purchase telescopes, the observational activities can begin, which will be very fun! The aerospace part is still under planning, and will probably start functioning a while later as compared to the other 2 segments. </p>

DSC IIT Bhilai was set-up primarily to ensure that we can bridge the divide between a student’s eagerness to learn and the technology evolving every day.
                      The Developer Student Clubs (DSC) program is a grassroots channel through which the members of the community provide development skills for students, towards employability. In addition to workshops, DSCs also provide an opportunity for students to apply their newly gained skills to develop solutions for local organizations and then provide visibility via showcases.We will be taking up projects and any individual, group or organization with a good idea for a project and a thought to create an impact by making lives of people better will be welcome. We welcome all the development projects that involve the latest technologies like App development, Machine Learning, Web Development, Cloud Development and much more.</p><br>
