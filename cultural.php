The society is a vibrant one, with lots of regular and interesting activities, that both serve to be fun as well as beneficial. Every student taking part in these activities is encouraged to come out of his/her shell and start communicating effectively. The society also has its own newsletter, called the Couch Potato. The contents are typically informal and talk about the most interesting things happening in and around the campus. In all, it is a society that's definitely worth joining, if you want a major upgrade to your people skills!</p>
